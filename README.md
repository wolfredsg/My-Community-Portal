# My-Community-Portal
Lithan Project Integrating Bulk Messaging to The Community Portal

This is my project for Lithan.

The community portal has a user type, Administrator, who manages the portal. 
Administrators need the functionality to send email communication to the registered software developers. 
Instead of developing bulk emailing functionality from scratch, find an open source bulk emailing software in Github, 
modify it and integrate it with the community portal to meet the requirements.
